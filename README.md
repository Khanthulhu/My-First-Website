On the DiceRoller page I have created a simple Javascript file that contains multiple quick funtions that make use of Javascripts Math.random() function in order to give the user simulated dice rolls every time the approiate button is pressed. The Javascript file contains multiple functions that simply send the approiate maximum value to the base function.

The final page, Animations. Uses CSS to standardize the size and shape of images and then uses webkit and keyframes to animate them approirately. The animations were made possible due to Animista by Ana Travis, whose website provided a quick and simply way to test and generate animations without having to manual edit keyframes via trail and error. 

All of the pages on this website use Django's Template system so that there is a base HTML that contains the header and footer and the content of the page is stored in a seperate document makes up the body. In order to run the Python code framework I created a git repository on my local machine that I then hosted on Github. Then I used the web hosting service PythonAnywhere to render this site.
